## Quik Chat
This app is a simple implementation of the Socket.io technology dealering with web sockets. My goal for the app was:
1. To understand the technology behind web sockets
2. To build something involving web sockets

### Directions:
Clone the repo and install the package
```
npm install
```

Run the app and enjoy quick, light chat options on the same port
```
node index.js
